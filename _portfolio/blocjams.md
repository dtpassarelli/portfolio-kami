## Explanation


Bloc Jams was a school project where I was able to apply my foundational knowledge to create a music app. In this project I wrote the entire application with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. After that was complete I rewrote most the JavaScript in JQuery. The objective here was to apply my foundational knowledge in JavaScript and at the same time see how JQuery works under the hood while I was learning to apply it.


## Problem


In this project we had multiple pages of code linking to together and a lot of fun and interesting code to make all of the seek bars and volume bars work. Another feature that was to be built in was making the play buttons animated and switch from pause to play when they were clicked. We also were to add a feature that updated the seek and play bar as the pause/play button were interacted with as well as the time the song had been playing.


## Solution


I animated the pause and play buttons in JavaScript DOM scripting first and then after completing that functionality in Javascript I went through and simplified it with JQuery. I found that using JQuery was very useful in making the code shorter. I also used some cool math percentages at the end to update the volume and seek bars. I multiplied the ratio by 100 to determine a percentage and used the Math.max and Math.min to make sure the bar did not exceed 100 percent. I used the JQuery Buzz Library to get the music to play in the app.




## Results


The results were a great looking application that functioned well and allowed me to practice my JavaScript and learn more about great ways to simplify my code using the JQuery library.


> Another great thing was learning how to test and debug my code. I ran into some challenges with the seekbar and had to go through several lines of code and test to see where I needed to adjust my code to get it functioning properly. Pseudocoding and making a lot of descriptive comments really helped me to know where to look and where to start making adjustments.




## Conclusion


To wrap up this was a great first school project. I feel that each feature built on what I have already learned while challenging me and introducing me to other great tools I can use to shorten my code but to also understand how all of it works under the hood. I also learned how to plan out my code in english and the tackle each feature piece by piece and how important it is to leave good note comments in your code. I canâ€™t wait to learn more!
