title: My Biggest Challenges as a Developer
---


One of the biggest challenges that I have had so far as a developer is keeping myself from going too far down one programming rabbit hole or another. I am the type of person that will obsess over a problem or a new technology and one of the things that I have had to learn is how to harness that in a productive way. When I do I am ten times more productive and end up learning a lot more of what I need to know and start to see patterns in the common problems that come up and how to solve them. I feel this really helps me to work on mastering the fundamentals and focusing my efforts on the most important things that will have the biggest impact and efficiency in my work.
