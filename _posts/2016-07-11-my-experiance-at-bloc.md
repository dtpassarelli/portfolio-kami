title: My Experience at Bloc
---


My experience at Bloc has been and amazing journey of growth learning and support! I feel like it has been on of the best experiences I have ever had as a student. When I first got started with Bloc the onboarding team was so helpful and supportive and your mentors are their the help you with all of your in depth questions in a way that is very easy to understand. One of the many great things about Bloc is you are still able to stay employed while you are working on completing the program. They are always constantly not only getting feedback from their students but are constantly applying solutions to that feedback to make their curiculum better. I would reccomend Bloc to anyone who has a passion for learning computer science because the education is top notch. Each level of the program gives you a chance to apply what you have learne and push your limits at the same time.
