title: My Goals As A Web Developer
---


I have many goals as a Web Developer. My most important of my goals is to find great mentors and friends in the same industry that will help push me to be a great programmer. I love this industry because to be great you have to evolve and grow constantly with the industry and that is really what I am all about. My goal after that is to put in my 10,000 hours and real hone in and sculpt my craft to become experienced enough to help other developers that are starting out and help them grow in the industry as well. Lastly I would love to work in industries that has a positive impact in the world and contribute to the tech in those developing industries.


> The best thing about this industry is that the possibilities are endless!
